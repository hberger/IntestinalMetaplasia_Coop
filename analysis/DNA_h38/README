General pipeline

- run GATK preprocessing (make sure to install GATK >= v4 and the GATK resource bundle for GRChg38). Exome sequencing calling also requires a definition of the capture regions in a bed file
- run Mutect2 for small variant calling for each sample compared to germ line, then merge calls from all samples and annotate using SnpEff
- run DeDup to remove duplicate reads
- run CNVkit/Contra/ADTex_CV for calling of copy number variants
